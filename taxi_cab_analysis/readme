This is a basic quick analysis of exploring Taxi-Cab in New York data. Further analysis and work is needed to have a more comprehensive understanding of the data and the models with the most predictiveness. The analysis is setup to have the taxi_cab python file do most of the heavy lifting and be imported into the notebook for exploration and training.

Files
- exploration.ipynb - python notebook to explore and run models
- taxi_cab.py - python file with the heavy code lifting
- requirements.txt - package list to install
- taxi_cab_results.csv - preliminray results generated from running models

How to run (~10-15 minutes without neural networks)
- I suggest creating a new virtual environment
- run pip install -r requirements.txt to install packages
- Open the file "exporation.ipynb" and run all cells
- If training neural network models is desired, set "run_neural_networks" to True when running the function "calc_results". It is set to False because of the amount of time needed to train.
